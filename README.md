## Information Design

The code in this repo is structured into three phases of a data lifecycle for information design. The primary examples in this class are based on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Colab notebooks](https://colab.google), but we will emphasize learning to "glue" together workflows to solve for your needs.

### Phase 1 - Inputs

Learning to find, explore, and analyze data.

- [End-to-End Demo](https://editor.p5js.org/brian-ho/full/kLYveWle6)

- [Tutorial 2](https://editor.p5js.org/brian-ho/sketches/rRmmwV7P_)

### Phase 2 - Process

Exploring how to create, interact with, and iterate on information design.
