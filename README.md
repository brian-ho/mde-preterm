## Information Design

The code in this repo is structured into three days, reflecting three phases in a data lifecycle for information design. The primary examples in this class are based on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Colab notebooks](https://colab.google), but we will emphasize learning to "glue" together workflows to solve for your needs.
